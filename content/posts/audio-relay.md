## Why on earth would I need that?

---

Well, I can describe a hundred scenarios but let's keep things short and real. 

I didn't have my BlueTooth speakers, In-built speakers were crap and I needed to feel the horror of [AnnaBelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg).

This is when I came across this beautiful app called [Audio Relay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azefsw.audioconnect&utm_source=website&utm_campaign=download&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1) which can stream the audio from your PC to the android device of your choice!

## Beta yet Better: Pros and Cons

---

The app is currently in Beta Phase yet it works like a charm. Aside from the initial setup, connecting your phone and PC requires less than 5 seconds!

### Pros:

- Easy to use
- Requires little to no effort
- Supports USB Channel streaming for the least lag
- Supports Multiple Devices at the same time.
- Can work with inbuilt speakers on

### Cons: 

- USB Streaming needs Premium Version
- Multi-Device support needs Premium Version
- Bluetooth can be unreliable sometimes.

## Setting Up

---

- Download the app on your PC from [Here](https://audiorelay.net/downloads) 
- Download the app on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azefsw.audioconnect&utm_source=website&utm_campaign=download&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1)
- Follow these quick instructions for [Initial Setup](https://docs.audiorelay.net/instructions/windows/stream-audio-from-your-pc-to-your-phone)
- Done!

## My Experience and Verdict

---

I'm constantly using it for 3 days as a replacement for the inbuilt speakers of my laptop and it works flawlessly.

The average ping stays between 20-30ms and the buffering is neglectable most of the time. Though I haven't tried the premium version but it opens up some whole new potentials such as:

- Each Homie gets their own speaker
- Surrounding Home Theater System
- Your Imagination!

Would I recommend it as a replacement for well-known speakers such as Bose or JBL? Probably not because of the difference in Sound Quality and Bass.

Would I recommend this as an extra set of speakers with better sound quality than your laptop? Hell yeah!
