## You're suggesting WHAT?

Wait, Wait! Before you blow with a Bazooka, no I'm not a supporter of invading your privacy neither a fan of trading Government IDs in exchange for a platform.

After wandering around the land of CEX aka Centralized Exchanges, I came across CoinEX, a rising platform which isn't as ID hungry as others.

While I still prefer DEX aka Decentralized Exchanges such as [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) or [BlockDX](https://blockdx.co/), this is just an option we are going to explore!

Always remember: **NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS!**



## What is this coin thing?

----------

[CoinEx]https://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=5f437) is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, launched in 2017 and has been continuously growing since.

After exploring quite a while, this struck me as any other general exchange. While the UI is clean and easy to use, I loved how distraction free it was. Also, it has an AMM [Automated Market Maker], generally referred to as a Liquidity Pool, which I use quite often to make some quick bucks. 

**Note:** Liquidity Pools are exposed to the risk of Impermanent Loss


## Trust or Bust?

----------

The first thing I do before using any service is go to Google and write "[Coinex](https://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=5f437) review” which presents a list of sites full of positive to negative reviews. As you can see, it has a great review on Trust Pilot!

But what about my personal experience?

Well, I personally *am* too picky when it comes to my assets. You won't leave your wallet laying in the middle of a mugging ground, right?

I have been using [the exchange](https://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=5f437) for about 2 years. [Yes an early one]

Never had a major issue. But recently 2 FA stopped working through the SMS but they replaced it with Authenticator within a day.

## There must be a hefty fee.

----------

Well, I wouldn't agree or deny it. [CoinEx](https://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=5f437) typically has hefty fees for BTC (Waves between 0.0002 – 0.0006 BTC), really depends on the network traffic or mining status.

That's really nothing we could control, but yes major exchanges does sometime saves up in exchange for your privacy

## Why not [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=46998971), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)?

-----------

KYC, No, Thanks.



## So, What are we waiting for?

-----------

I don't know, frankly, [CoinEX](https://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=5f437) is just one link click away. Let me know how it goes for you. Also, Did I miss any exquisite feature? Let me know in the comments!
